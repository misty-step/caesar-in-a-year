# Vision

## One-Liner
The best Latin learning app for reading Caesar's De Bello Gallico in one year.

## North Star
Users who stick with the program actually read Latin fluently. The learning loop is so good—AI grading so accurate, spaced repetition so effective, daily habit so sticky—that completion rates far exceed other language learning apps.

## Key Differentiators
- AI-powered translation grading that gives meaningful feedback (not just right/wrong)
- FSRS spaced repetition tuned specifically for Latin vocabulary retention
- Focused scope: one text, one year, clear progress
- Simple, distraction-free interface

## Target User
Self-motivated adults who want to read classical Latin but failed with traditional textbooks or apps. They want to read Caesar, not just conjugate verbs.

## Current Focus
Core learning loop excellence. Make the daily session experience perfect before worrying about growth, social features, or expanding content.
