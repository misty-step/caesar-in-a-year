## Checkpoint 0: Critical Bug Fixes [BLOCKER]

Must fix before real user testing.

| ID | Task | Files | Status |
|----|------|-------|--------|
| 0.3 | Document content licensing (Perseus/MIT commercial restrictions) | README.md, Footer.tsx | DONE |

**Resolution**: No licensing issue. Latin text (~50 BCE) and McDevitte & Bohn translation (1869) are both public domain. Added attribution to README and Footer for best practice.
